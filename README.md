Solved 2 problems from leet code  
1.Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).  
  Return the running sum of nums.[leet code link](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)  
  Time Complexity = O(n)  
  type: easy

2.Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.  
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
