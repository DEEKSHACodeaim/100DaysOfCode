# 100DaysOfCode
This is the 100 days of code challenge that I took up decided to code everyday  and commit the progress everyday for 100 days 
# RULES:
I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
Start Date:

# DAILY LOG:
## Day1-1/1/2023 ->Prefix Sum  
Solved 2 problems from leet code  
1.Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).  
  Return the running sum of nums.[leet code link](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)
  Time Complexity = O(n)  
  Space Complexity = O(n)  
  type: easy

2.Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.  
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
